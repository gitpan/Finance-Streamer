Revision history for Perl extension Finance::Streamer.

1.08  Tue, 27 Aug 2002 11:56:57 -0700

 * Fix of documentation errors: forgot to rename
  'receive_state' to 'receive_all' in some places.

   Thanks to Doug Stave <doug@peopleplace.com> for finding this problem.

1.07 Wed Jan  2 16:38:23 PST 2002

	- Clean up of code and documentation.

1.06 Wed May 23 23:23:17 PDT 2001

	- added receive_all() subroutine that passes all the latest
	  data instead of just the new data

	- a subroutine to execute when a heartbeat occurs can now be specified

	- changed name of subroutine filter() to Parser(), to make its
	  purpose clearer

1.05 Wed May 23 04:33:41 PDT 2001

	- bug fixes and ideas thanks to Steve Haehnichen <steve@trix.com>

		- Changed user agent id default to an id specific to this 
		  library instead of an id of the Streamer applet.

		- Changed 'select' to 'fields' due to potential conflicts
		  with reserved word 'select'.

	- Changed name of sub for receive() from 'sub' to 'sub_recv'
	  to avoid potential reserved word conflicts.

	- Removed option to filter or not in recieve().  Was not worth the
	  confusion it caused.

	- Updated documentation to reflect changes.

1.04 Tue May 22 21:06:24 PDT 2001

	- bug fixes thanks to Steve Haehnichen <steve@trix.com>

		- doc error for select 20 should have been 21.
		
		- Symbol length error for '^COMPX'.


1.03  Tue May 22 01:37:07 PDT 2001

	- I added timouts for all recv() subroutines in receive().
	  This was required to stop the situation of waiting forever
	  for data to arrive.

	- Overall cleanup of code and documentation.

1.02  Mon Apr  9 05:17:40 PDT 2001

	- changed names of select values
	  last00s -> last_size

	- Added a link to the Data::Dumper module in the documentation.  
	  The module is very helpful for visualizing the data returned
	  by the "filter" subroutine.

1.01  Sat Apr  7 02:20:13 2001

	- original version
